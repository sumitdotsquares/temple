                <p>
                The candidate is expected to work with Prof. Benjamin Seibold on a research project to develop scalable moment method simulations for radiation transport, including modern visualization techniques (virtual reality) and applications in nuclear medicine.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                Expertise in radiation transport, moment methods, high-performance computing, VR/Unity, and/or nuclear medicine is desirable and should be stressed in the cover letter. However, general experience in computational partial differential equations and numerical analysis is also welcome. Candidates should have a Ph.D. in Mathematics, or a related field, by the time of appointment.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                Applications should be submitted on-line through www.mathjobs.org and should include (1) the AMS cover sheet for academic employment, (2) curriculum vitae, (3) research and teaching statements, and (4) three letters of recommendation, one of which discusses the candidate's teaching qualifications.
                </p>
                
                <p>
