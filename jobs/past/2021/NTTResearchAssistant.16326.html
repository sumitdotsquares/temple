 We are looking for candidates to participate in an interdisciplinary project studying microbial communities growing on stone monuments. Duties will involve a combination of field work, data analysis, and mathematical modeling. The candidate is expected to collaborate with Dr. Isaac Klapper. Prior experience or interest in modeling of microbial communities including their physical and chemical properties is welcome but not required, as is previous experience with data analysis. Candidates should have a Ph.D. in mathematics or a related field by the time of appointment. Applications should be submitted on-line through www.mathjobs.org and should include (1) the AMS cover sheet for academic employment, (2) curriculum vitae, (3) research and teaching statements, and (4) four letters of recommendation, one of which discusses the candidate's teaching qualifications. Please direct all inquiries to mathematics@temple.edu.

 Screening of applications will begin on December 1, 2020, and will continue until the position is filled. Temple University is an affirmative action/equal opportunity employer. In a continuing effort to enrich its academic environment and provide equal educational and employment opportunities the department actively encourages applications from women and members of all ethnic groups underrepresented in Mathematics. The Department of Mathematics of Temple University abides by the AMS postdoctoral offer response date guidelines.
