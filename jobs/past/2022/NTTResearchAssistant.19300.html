                We are looking for candidates to participate in an interdisciplinary project studying microbial communities growing on stone monuments. Duties will involve a combination of field work, data analysis, and mathematical modeling. The candidate is expected to collaborate with Dr. Isaac Klapper. Prior experience or interest in modeling of microbial communities including their physical and chemical properties is welcome but not required, as is previous experience with data analysis. Candidates should have a Ph.D. in mathematics or a related field by the time of appointment. Applications should be submitted on-line through www.mathjobs.org and should include (1) the AMS cover sheet for academic employment, (2) curriculum vitae, (3) research and teaching statements, and (4) four letters of recommendation, one of which discusses the candidate's teaching qualifications. Please direct all inquiries to mathematics@temple.edu.
