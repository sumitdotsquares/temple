The Department of Mathematics, Temple University, is inviting applications for a postdoctoral position as an NTT Research Assistant Professor. This is a non-tenure-track appointment.<br>

The appointment is for two years, to start on July 1st, 2018, or at another mutually agreeable date. The appointment may be extended for a third year.<br>

This research position is part of a project on asynchronous parallel methods for the solutions of PDEs using Schwarz methods. The ideal candidate will have knowledge of Domain Decomposition methods and/or parallel codes, and possibly asynchronous iterations.<br>

In addition to the research project, the candidate is expected to teach a light teaching load at least for the first year of the appointment.<br>

Applications should include the standard AMS Cover Sheet for Academic Employment, a cover letter, a curriculum vitae, and a statement about current and future research. A complete application will also include at least three letters of recommendations. All application materials should be submitted via mathjobs.org.<br>

Inquiries may be directed to szyld@temple.edu

Review of applications will begin immediately.<br>

The Department of Mathematics, Temple University, anticipates that several non-tenure-track, instructional, full time, short-term positions (with possibility of renewal) will become available beginning 2018-2019, primarily at the ranks of Instructional (Non Tenure Track) Instructor or Instructional (Non Tenure Track) Assistant Professor. Appointees will be expected to teach a range of courses, and so in most cases a Ph.D. in mathematics will be required. These positions will typically carry a 3-3 teaching load (or equivalent). Evaluation of submissions will begin immediately, but applications will receive consideration until the position(s) are filled.<br> 

Each application should include a CV, a letter detailing teaching experience, and at least three letters of recommendation from faculty with direct knowledge of the applicantâ€™s teaching effectiveness. Please submit your application through mathjobs.org.<br>
