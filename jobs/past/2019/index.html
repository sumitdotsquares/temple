                <p>
                Temple University, Department of Mathematics, is seeking a (non-tenure track) Research Assistant Professor in Applied Mathematics starting January 2020. The initial appointment is for one year, with the possibility of an extension to a second year. The position carries no teaching in the first year.
                <p>
                The candidate is expected to work with Prof. Benjamin Seibold (Temple University Mathematics) and Prof. Matthew Helmus (Temple University Biology) on a cross-disciplinary research project on the first-principles modeling of invasive species, with a specific focus on the spotted lanternfly.
                <p>
                The spotted lanternfly is an invasive Asian planthopper that was discovered near Philadelphia USA in 2014. Hitchhiking on cars and laying eggs on transported goods, it has since spread to five states. Feeding on maples, apples, hops, and grapes, it is a substantial economic threat. There is a critical need to understand and predict the patterns of spread via mathematical models, and the potential disruptions to agricultural and natural ecosystems.
                <p>
                Expertise in mathematical modeling, partial differential equations, numerical methods, and programming is required, and experience in life-science research is an important additional asset for the project. Candidates should have a Ph.D. in Mathematics, Physics, Biology, or other related fields, by the time of appointment.
                <p>
                Applications should be submitted through mathjobs.org and should include a cover letter, a CV, a research statement, and at least three letters of recommendation.
                
                <p>
                Screening of applications will begin immediately, and will continue until the position is filled. Temple University is an affirmative action/equal opportunity employer, and especially encourages applications from women and minority candidates.
