	<h3>New Faculty Member: <a href="/~notlaw">Chelsea Walton</a>  </h3>

	<div style='margin-top:10px;'><p>Dr. Chelsea Walton joined the department in July 2015 as Selma Lee Bloch Brown Assistant Professor. Her research interests lie in noncommutative algebra, with a special focus on quantum symmetries.</p><p>Symmetry is a classical notion that arises in biology, architecture, music, and a variety of other fields. Mathematically, a symmetry of an object \(X\) is an invertible operation (or action) that sends \(X\) as a whole to itself. The collection of symmetries of \(X\) forms an algebraic structure: a group. Classically, symmetries are observed, yet in the quantum setting observability is rather unintuitive. So, in order to study symmetries of quantum objects, once needs to first replace the quantum object, say \(X_q\), with the algebra of functions \(A_q\) on \(X_q\). Generally, \(A_q\) has noncommutative multiplication. Secondly, one needs to work with certain generalizations of groups, namely quantum groups, which have the structure of a Hopf algebra. In fact, one can think of a Hopf algebra as the collection of symmetries of \(X_q\) that are not necessarily invertible. So, in particular, Walton examines Hopf actions on (noncommutative) algebras.</p><p>Walton's contributions to this field include the study (of the lack) of quantum symmetries on commutative domains, Weyl algebras, "Artin-Schelter regular" algebras, and path algebras of quivers. Results on deformations of "smash product algebras" arising from such actions have also been established.</p><p>Moreover, Walton also has interests and has made contributions in noncommutative algebraic geometry, a field which is especially useful to analyze noncommutative algebras whose origins lie in physics. In particular, in joint work with S. Sierra, Walton proved that the universal enveloping algebra of the Witt algebra is not noetherian, answering a 23-year old problem of C. Dean and L. W. Small.</p><p>Walton comes to Temple from MIT, where she was an NSF postdoctoral fellow and C.L.E. Moore Instructor, and from the University of Washington-Seattle, where she was an NSF Postdoctoral Fellow. She completed her graduate work at the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor and the University of Manchester (as a visiting student) under the direction of Toby Stafford and Karen Smith. She is originally from Detroit, Michigan.</p><p>Walton's research is funded by the NSF.</p></div>

	<h3>New Faculty Member: <a href="/~queisser">Gillian Queisser</a> </h3>

	<div style='margin-top:10px;'><p>Dr. S. Gillian Queisser joined our department in July 2015 as Associate Professor. Dr. Queisser's research interests include numerics and scientific computing, high-performance computing, and applications to the life sciences.</p><p>Queisser's primary research goal is to move the frontiers of computation-based neuroscience toward a discipline driven by physical first principles, numerical methods and large scale simulations. Since computational methods in neuroscience are currently based on analogies, rather than detailed physical models, Queisser and his research group use and develop numerical methods for large scale computing in order to solve systems of non-linear partial differential equations. These systems define continuum-based models of three-dimensional neuronal processes on intricate morphologies. Queisser's work on numerical and computational methods has brought forth new and robust grid refinement strategies for geometric multigrid methods exposed to highly complex computational domains, adaptive grid refinement, and space/time-parallel multiscale simulation methods.</p><p>Queisser is also currently extending his interdisciplinary approach to "virtual medicine" by coupling electrical, biochemical and mechanical processes, and by developing efficient numerical methods, to help transform medical procedure from an experience-governed discipline to an optimized and individualized process.</p><p>Queisser completed his PhD thesis in 2008 at the Ruprecht-Karls University of Heidelberg. During his graduate studies he was Research Associate at the Simulation in Technology Research Group at the University of Heidelberg. From 2008 to 2010 he was Independent Research Group Leader of the Computational Neuroscience Research Group at the Cluster of Excellence CellNetworks at the University of Heidelberg. From 2010 until joining Temple, he was W-1 Professor at the Department of Computer Science and Mathematics of the Goethe University of Frankfurt.</p><p>Dr. Queisser's research has been supported by the CellNetworks Cluster of Excellence and the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research.</p></div>

on Algebraic Operads and Related Structures.</i></a> From the abstract: "The
principal investigator is tackling the Deligne-Drinfeld conjecture on the
Grothendieck-Teichmueller Lie algebra using the deformation complex of the
operad governing Gerstenhaber algebras and Kontsevich's graph complex related
to deformation quantization. The PI is working on a circle of problems related
to the modular operad which is obtained by applying the Feynman transform to
the operad governing commutative algebras. The PI also works on the problem of
deformation quantization over a graded base and studies a higher categorical
structure on homotopy algebras. The study of the Grothendieck-Teichmueller Lie
algebra is motivated by its links to deformation quantization, the absolute
Galois group of rational numbers and the theory of motives. Questions about
the Feynman transform of the operad governing commutative algebras are
motivated by the study of spaces of long knots." The award amount is
$160K.</p></div>

new NSF grant, <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1517100&HistoricalAwards=false"><i>Collaborative
Research: Connecting Omics to Physical and Chemical Environment in Community
Microbial Ecology</i></a>. From the abstract: "The investigators study an
important microbial community type, namely biofilms driven by photosynthesis,
particularly as subaerial biofilms (subaerial biofilms are generally
non-submerged microbial communities, living together in close proximity in
self-secreted polymeric matrices and exposed to air) on carbonate stones. The
context of the project is cultural environments, specifically microorganisms
that attach to stone and grow as biofilms. These communities can discolor and
degrade cultural monuments, but, at the same time, can offer useful insights
into many microbial communities by providing platforms for developing and
testing hypotheses of microbial ecology. Biofilms inhabiting outdoor stonework
have advantages in this respect. They contain the essential biocomplexity for
survival in open, uncontrolled environments, but, because of the relatively
stringent conditions typical of exposed stone, still have amenable ecologies,
and also are known to demonstrate mutually beneficial associations with
cooperating photosynthetic and nonphotosynthetic organisms. Particularly
important, their simplicity and accessibility make them well suited for use as
subjects for development of prototype mathematical methodology needed for
connecting omics-based cell-level metabolic models to physics-based
community-level function models. The linkage of community data to community
model is an essential piece, and one for which mathematics is central, in the
broad program of transforming omics into useable theory of microbial
communities which, in turn, is central to the program of modern
microbiology. This project aims to construct multiscale population models
capable of accepting omics (e.g., genomics, transcriptomics) and physical
(e.g., temperature, light intensity) data at the microscale, and to develop
mathematical methods for bridging the gap between community level omics and
community level population models. The core target are the modes of regulation
among microbial community members and how they are effected by the physical
environment."</p></div>
