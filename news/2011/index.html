	<h3>Marvin Knopp: 1933-2011</h3>

	<div style='margin-top:10px;'><p><p>With great sadness we report that Professor Marvin Knopp passed
away December 24 while visiting family in Florida. He joined the
Department of Mathematics at Temple in 1976. Prior to coming to Temple
he held appointments at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and the
University of Illinois, Chicago. He obtained his Ph.D. in 1958 from
the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, under the direction of
Paul Bateman. Professor Knopp was born in 1933 in Chicago, Illinois.
</p></p><p><p>Professor Knopp was a leading expert in the theory of Modular Forms,
and he twice gave invited addresses to meetings of the American
Mathematical Society. He had over 70 publications. In 2007 the
International Journal of Number Theory dedicated a volume in his
honor.
</p></p><p><p>Over the course of his career Professor Knopp supervised 20
Ph.D. students. He was active mathematically up to the time of his
death, and he was supervising the Ph.D. thesis of Austin Daughton, who
is currently writing a dissertation based on the research he completed
under Professor Knopp's direction.
</p></p><p><p>A brief appreciation, by Professor J. A. Paulos, can be found <a href="http://www.math.temple.edu/news/archive/paulos-knopp.html">here</a>. </p><p><p>Memorial activities are being planned.

	<h3>Numerical Analysis Day</h3>

	<div style='margin-top:10px;'><p><p>On November 4 the Department of Mathematics hosted a one-day
conference on numerical analysis. The keynote speaker was Lisa Fauci,
Pendergraft Nola Lee Haynes Professor of Mathematics, Tulane
University. She lectured on "Waving rings and swimming in circles:
some lessons learned in biofluiddynamics." The remainder of the talks
were given by young researchers: Eighteen graduate students and
postdoctoral fellows from Maryland to New York, and from Pittsburgh to
Delaware, gave presentations. More details can be found <a

	<h3>Benjamin Seibold and Prince Chidyagwai awarded new NSF grant</h3>

	<div style='margin-top:10px;'><p><p>Assistant Professor Benjamin Seibold is PI, and Postdoctoral
Research Assistant Professor Prince Chidyagwai is co-PI, on the new
NSF Grant <a
href="http://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=1115269">Numerical
approaches for incompressible viscous flows with high order accuracy
up to the boundary</a>. The award is for $299,922. From the abstract:
"In many applications in science and engineering, the accurate and
efficient computation of forces and stresses at boundaries between
fluids and solids is of crucial importance. Examples in which boundary
forces (in the form of lift and drag) are key quantities of interest
are the design of airplane wings, motor vehicles, and wind turbines,
as well as the simulation of sedimentation in stratified fluids and
bio-locomotion. The investigators are researching new methodologies
and implementations of approaches that allow for a highly accurate
computation of these boundary forces." </p></p>

	<h3>Daniel Szyld and Fei Xue awarded new NSF grant</h3>

	<div style='margin-top:10px;'><p><p>Professor Daniel Szyld is PI, and Postdoctoral Research Assistant
Professor Fei Xue is co-PI, on the new NSF grant, <a
href="http://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=1115520">Eigenvalues
problems, Krylov subspace methods, and subspace recycling</a>. The
award is for $280,000. From the abstract: "The problems to be studied
in this project include the efficient computation of a group of
eigenvalues and the solution of sequences of linear
systems. Eigenvalue calculations include analysis of vibration
frequencies in structures including buildings, to make sure, for
example, that they are far from the earthquake band. Fast algorithms
for generalized eigenvalue problems also contribute to the design and
analysis of electronic integrated circuit and micro-electro-mechanical
systems (MEMS), and the detection of potential presence of turbulent
fluid flows. Efficient solution of a sequence of linear systems
facilitates modeling of fatigue and fracture via finite element
analysis, and the stability analysis of linear systems through the
solution of Riccati equations."  </p></p></div>
