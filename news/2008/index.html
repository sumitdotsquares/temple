	<h3>Grabovsky of Mathematics Solves Celebrated Open Problem </h3>

	<div style='margin-top:10px;'><p><p>Mathematics Associate Professor <a href=
    "http://www.math.temple.edu/~yury/">Yury Grabovsky</a>, with
    graduate student Tadele Mengesha, recently solved an important
    open problem in the calculus of variations, the one-dimensional
    version of which was stated by Karl Weierstrass in the 1800s
    and subsequently established by David Hilbert. The proof of
    quasiconvexity based sufficient conditions for strong local
    minima in vectorial variational problems consists of three
    major parts: the Decomposition Theorem, the Orthogonality
    principle and the Localization principle. Sir John Ball,
    Sedleian Professor of Natural Philosophy at the University of
    Oxford, called this an "absolutely fundamental result and a
    really fantastic paper, one of the best of recent years in the
    calculus of variations."&nbsp; This problem is relevant to a
    wide variety of phenomena ranging from fluid flow to
    magnetostatics. Grabovsky delivered a <a href=
    "https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/search/node/Yury+Grabovsky">lecture
    series</a> at Oxford on his results in early October.</p></p></div>

	<h3>TUteach degrees approved </h3>

	<div style='margin-top:10px;'><p><p>In November 2007, Temple University was one of twelve
    institutions to receive a National Math and Science Initiative
    grant to replicate the existing UTeach program at The
    University of Texas at Austin. On May 13, 2008, the six majors
    in which TUteach students will earn degrees were approved by
    the Temple University Board of Trustees.</p></p><p>    <p>Students will begin earning Bachelor of Science degrees in
    Biology with Teaching, Mathematics with Teaching, Chemistry
    with Teaching, Earth and Space Science with Teaching, Physics
    with Teaching and General Science with Teaching in Fall 2008.
    All six majors will require 50-65 science credits and 20-27
    credits in UTeach pedagogy, liberal arts or research. Based on
    UTeach degree models, the new majors are designed to provide
    graduates with two separate knowledge sets; scientific content
    knowledge and pedagogical understanding of how to convey that
    information.</p></p><p>    <p>CST is working closely with the College of Education, the
    UTeach program and the National Math and Science Initiative to
    help Temple students planning to become middle and high school
    teachers to most effectively educate young people in science
    and technology.</p></p></div>
