	<h3>Kirk Soodhalter participated in Modeling     Workshop</h3>

	<div style='margin-top:10px;'><p>Kirk Soodhalter, a mathematics graduate student, was
    accepted to participate in the NSF-supported 2009 Industrial
    Mathematical and Statistical Modeling Workshop for Graduate
    Students (see http://www.ncsu.edu/crsc/imsm/). The workshop was
    held in July at the campus of North Carolina State University.
    he was placed on a team studying Resource Issues Impacting
    National Security. In this project, they analyzed an existing
    model of the world's supply of natural resources taking into
    account dependencies on population growth, increased demand,
    and various economic factors. They applied sensitivity analysis
    to the model in order to discover important relationships and
    then recommended future directions of research.</p></div>
