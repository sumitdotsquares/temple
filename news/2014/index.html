	<h3>Benjamin Seibold awarded new NSF grant</h3>

	<div style='margin-top:10px;'><p><p>Assistant Professor Benjamin Seibold is PI on a new NSF research grant, <a
href="http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1446690&HistoricalAwards=false"><i>Cyber-Physical
Systems: Synergy: Collaborative Research: Control of Vehicular Traffic Flow
via Low Density Autonomous Vehicles</i></a>. From the abstract: "This project
develops new models, computational methods, software tools, and engineering
solutions to employ autonomous vehicles to detect and mitigate traffic events
that adversely affect fuel consumption and congestion. The approach is to
combine the data measured by autonomous vehicles in the traffic flow, as well
as other traffic data, with appropriate macroscopic traffic models to detect
and predict congestion trends and events. Based on this information, the loop
is closed by carefully following prescribed velocity controllers that are
demonstrated to reduce congestion." The award amount (to Temple) is 
$240,000 and begins January 1, 2015.</p></p><p><p>Dr. Seibold's research on this project is in
mutlidisciplinary collaboration with Jonathan Sprinkle (U. Arizona, Electrical
and Computer Engineering), Daniel Work (Civil and Environmental Engineering,
U. Illinois Urbana-Champaign), and Benedetto Piccoli (Mathematical Sciences
and Center for Computational and Integrative Biology, Rutgers University,
Camden).</p></p></div>

	<h3>Daniel Szyld awarded new NSF grant</h3>

	<div style='margin-top:10px;'><p><p>Professor Daniel Szyld has been awarded a new three-year NSF research
grant, <i><a
href="http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1418882&HistoricalAwards=false">Multiple
preconditioners for saddle-point and other problems</a></i>. From the
abstract: "There are many problems in science and engineering where one deals
with two completely different phenomena, but these two phenomena influence one
another (or one influences the other). One example of this situation is fluid
flow along two different kinds of media. One flow is free, as in water in a
river, and the other is constrained by some porous media, as the fluid seeping
through below the river bed. When one tries to describe these physical
phenomena, one needs to use very different equations for each of the two, in
addition to taking into account what happens in their interphase. In this
project, the PI shall study the solution of systems of equations of the kind
just described. The PI shall combine solution techniques developed for each of
the two phenomena, so that the resulting combination gives us an efficient
computational tool." The award amount is $150,000.</p></p></div>

	<div style='margin-top:10px;'><p><p>Associate Professor David Futer has been awarded a new three-year NSF research
grant, <i><a
href="http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1408682&HistoricalAwards=false">Connections
in low-dimensional topology</a></i>. From the abstract: "This project seeks to
build and strengthen connections among the following perspectives in
low-dimensional topology: combinatorial topology, hyperbolic geometry, quantum
invariants, and group theory. This goal splits into several sub-projects. The
first sub-project is to build explicit combinatorial models for hyperbolic
3-manifolds based on the combinatorial data of a fibration over the
circle. The second sub-project is to use quantum invariants such as the Jones
and colored Jones polynomials to gain information about the boundary slopes of
knots, fibration data, and hyperbolic volume. The third sub-project is to use
ideas from 3-dimensional triangulations to build metric models for hyperbolic
groups." The award amount is $155,000.</p></p></div>

	<h3>Yury Grabovsky awarded new NSF grant</h3>

	<div style='margin-top:10px;'><p><p>Professor Yury Grabovsky has been awarded a new three-year NSF research
grant, <i><a
href="http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1412058&HistoricalAwards=false">Linear
and non-linear elasticity: Study of exact relations and
instabilities</a></i>. From the abstract: "This project revolves around two
central themes: stability and heterogeneity of materials and structures,
examining them from different perspectives. The heterogeneity can be
artificial, or man-made, as in composite materials, or it can be created
spontaneously by nature as in shape memory alloys or in some of the buckling
patterns of cylindrical shells. In the former case the dependence of the
macroscopic properties of materials on their microstructure is the subject of
this study, where the goal is to uncover all instances where exact formulas
can be established between the properties of constituent materials and the
composite, regardless of the microstructure. Undergraduate research is an
essential part of this project. In the latter case the creation of
microstructure is caused by instabilities that are explained by the principle
of minimum energy. Mathematically rigorous determination of whether it is
possible to lower the energy of a configuration is an important question,
especially when the configuration is already heterogeneous. Another important
example of instability is buckling of cylindrical shells. These structures are
especially interesting because theoretically predicted buckling compression
can be up to five times higher than the experimentally observed one due to
high sensitivity to initial imperfections. A newly developed theory of
buckling, of which the investigator is a coauthor, shows promise in giving a
new explanation of extreme sensitivity of the buckling load to
imperfections."</p></p></div>

	<h3>Brian Rider awarded new NSF grant</h3>

	<div style='margin-top:10px;'><p><p>Professor Brian Rider has been awarded a new three-year NSF research grant,
<i><a
href="http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1406107&HistoricalAwards=false">Limit
laws arising in random matrix theory</a></i>. From the abstract: "The proposed
research builds in part on the PI's recent work on the general beta extensions
of the Tracy-Widom and related distributions. These extensions have the
advantage of embedding the more familiar triple(s) of limit laws (tied to the
orthogonal, unitary and symplectic symmetry classes) into a one-parameter
family of distributions defined via random differential operators. The first
goal is to extend universality results for these distributions using the
random operator approach. A second goal is to establish non-communative
versions of certain Brownian functional identities (for instance, the Dufresne
identities) of current interest given their role in the KPZ universality
class. The final project is to prove universal local limit theorems for a
class of solvable logarithmic gas ensembles of multiple charges which
interpolate among the classical orthogonal, unitary, and symplectic
ensembles." The award amount is $210,000.</p></p>
