	<h3>Shiferaw Berhanu awarded three-year NSF grant.</h3>

	<div style='margin-top:10px;'><p>Professor Shiferaw Berhanu was awarded a three-year NSF grant in the amount of $199,687 for a project entitled "Regularity of CR Mappings on Embeddable and Abstract CR Manifolds".</p><p>From the abstract: The aim of the project is to study the solutions of systems of partial differential equations which arise in several complex variables. Results from such work have applications to many important problems in complex variables and partial differential equations. These applications include the regularity of the solutions of equations, and convergence of solutions for which only their Taylor series coefficients are known. Some of the partial differential equations in this project are relevant to physical applications.</p><p>The main part of the project involves the problem of understanding geometric conditions that imply that a sufficiently smooth CR mapping between two CR manifolds is smooth when the manifolds are smooth, and real analytic when the manifolds are real analytic. Closely related problems that will be investigated include the local and microlocal regularity of CR functions on abstract CR manifolds. 
The tools that may be used include a new family of FBI transforms, analytic discs, and the methods developed in the theory of holomorphic extendability of CR functions on hypersurfaces.</p></div>

	<h3>Sonia Kovalevsky Day 2016 </h3>

	<div style='margin-top:10px;'><p>Temple University hosted its fifth annual Sonia Kovalevsky Day, on Saturday, April 16, 2016. 50 middle-school girls from the Philadelphia area and beyond learned about code breaking, deceptive data, the mathematics of sudoku, the golden ratio, and the mathematics of pizza. The girls also participated in a challenging individual competition.</p><p>The instructors were Sogol Baharlou (Engineering), Brian Filips (Mathematics), Fiona Galzarano (Mathematics), Beca Lufi (Mathematics), Kathryn-Lund Nguyen (Mathematics), and Sarah Roden (Mathematics). The teaching assistants were Ramya Ailavajhala (Engineering), Mei Rose Conor (High School student), Joshua Finkelstein (Mathematics), Sowmya Srinivasan (Mathematics), William Worden (Mathematics), and Yilin Wu (Mathematics). Dr. Meredith Hegg (Mathematics) gave the opening remarks. The event was organized by Professors Maria Lorenz and Irina Mitrea.</p></div>

	<h3>Cristian Gutierrez awarded new NSF research grant </h3>

	<div style='margin-top:10px;'><p>
<p>Professor Cristian Gutierrez was awarded a new three-year NSF grant, <a
href="http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1600578&HistoricalAwards=false"><i>OP:
Monge-Ampere type equations and geometric optics</i></a>. </p><p>From the abstract:
"The design of lenses and mirrors is currently made computationally with ray
tracing (i.e., by software calculating the trajectory of the light rays), in
which choices are based upon educated guesses. This project is concerned with
the development of mathematical methods for the design of lenses, mirrors, and
antennas. It provides a better understanding than past approaches of the
design problems and enables one to adapt the solutions to the needs required
for any specific application. It develops models that are physically more
accurate than earlier ones and takes into account, for example, internal
reflection. The project addresses theoretical aspects of nonlinear partial
differential equations with concrete problems in optics and photonics. In
addition, the principal investigator is concerned with the mathematical
descriptions of the loss of energy due to bending in waveguides, chromatic
aberration for lenses, and variations of refractive indices in materials, in
particular, negative refraction. A part of the research concerns the
development of an algorithm for the numerical calculation of lenses." The award
amount to date is $160,000.</p></p></div>
