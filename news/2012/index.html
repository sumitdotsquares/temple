	<h3>Conference in memory of Professor Marvin Knopp (1933-2011)</h3>

	<div style='margin-top:10px;'><p><p>The Department of Mathematics hosted the
<a href="https://math.temple.edu/events/knopp/">Marvin Knopp Memorial
Conference</a>, November 11-12. Talks were presented by George Andrews
(Pennsylvania State University and former President of the American
Mathematical Society), Bruce Berndt (University of Illinois,
Urbana-Champaign), YoungJu Choie (Pohang University of Science and

(Rutgers University). This conference was sponsored in part by the
Number Theory Foundation. Conference organizers were Edward Letzter,
Geoffrey Mason, and Wladimir Pribitkin.</p></p><p><p>In addition to the mathematical program, there was a memorial
concert performance by the Peabody Trio (Seth Knopp, piano; Natasha
Brofsky, cello; Violaine Melancon, violin). A memorial banquet
followed the performance.</p></p><p><p>Professor Knopp joined the Department of Mathematics in 1976. He

pioneering figure in the theory of Eichler cohomology, modular
integrals, and generalized modular forms.</p></p><p><p>An article in Temple News on Professor Knopp and the conference can
be found <a href="http://news.temple.edu/news/2012-11-13/mathematics-conference-honors-late-temple-professor-marvin-knopp">here</a>.</p></p>

	<h3>New postdoctoral faculty: Alexander Hoffnung, Sunnie Joshi, Sui-Chung Ng, Brian Rushton, and Elia Ziade</h3>

	<div style='margin-top:10px;'><p>Our department welcomed five new Postdoctoral Assistant Professors for 2012-2013: Alexander Hoffnung (Ph.D. from University of California, Riverside) studies combinatorial, geometric and algebraic methods in representation theory, as motivated by mathematical physics. Sunnie Joshi (Ph.D. from Texas A&M University) works on mechanics of biological and in particular cardio-vascular materials, continuum mechanics, partial differential equations, numerical analysis and inverse problems. Sui-Chung NG (Ph.D. from University of Hong Kong) specializes in complex geometry and several complex variables, particularly in the geometry of bounded symmetric domains. Brian Rushton (Ph.D. from Brigham Young University) studies 3-manifold theory, hyperbolic geometry, and geometric group theory. Elia Ziade (Ph.D. from University of Missouri) studies functional analysis, harmonic analysis and partial differential equations.</p></div>

	<h3>New faculty member: Brian Rider</h3>

	<div style='margin-top:10px;'><p>Professor Brian Rider joined our department in July 2012. Rider is a probabilist whose current research is focused on random matrix theory. The study of (large dimensional) random matrices has somewhat humble roots in multivariate statistics dating from the early part of the last century, but has grown to have important implications for an enormous range of areas including combinatorics, information theory, operator algebras, number theory, theoretical physics, and integrable systems. Rider's recent work has resulted in new descriptions of some of the most basic distributions in random matrix theory, forming yet additional connections to different fields.
Rider comes to Temple from University of Colorado Boulder. Prior to that he held postdoctoral positions at the Technion and Duke University; he earned his Ph.D at NYU under the direction of Henry P. McKean, Jr. In 2008, Rider was a recipient of the Rollo Davidson Prize, an international prize awarded annually to leading young probabilists. In 2012, Rider was awarded a Simons Fellowship. (These fellowships are highly competitive awards recently initiated by the Simons Foundation; Jim Simons is a mathematician and hugely successful hedge fund manager.) Rider's research has been funded by the NSF and he currently holds an NSF CAREER grant.
Brian and his wife Jennifer (and kids ages 1 and 4) are delighted to be returning to the Northeast after many years. Both have always had a special fondness for Philadelphia, though Rider will remain a Sabres fan.</p></div>

	<h3>New faculty member: Isaac Klapper</h3>

	<div style='margin-top:10px;'><p>Professor Isaac Klapper joined our department in July 2012. Prior to coming to Temple, Klapper was a professor in the Department of Mathematical Sciences and the Center for Biofilm Engineering, Montana State University, where he was awarded the Montana State University Charles & Nora L. Wiley Faculty Award for Meritorious Research. Klapper has also held appointments at UCLA, the University of Arizona, and Columbia University.
Klapper earned his Ph.D in 1991 at New York University under the direction of Steve Childress. While there he was awarded a Fulbright Fellowship for study at Cambridge and Newcastle Universities in the UK. Afterwards, he received an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship. While originally studying magnetohydrodynamics in the context of solar magnetic fields, more recently he has been interested in using mathematical methods to model and develop theory for microbial communities, particularly biofilms. To better facilitate communication between mathematicians and microbiologists, Klapper has, together with mathematics graduate students, been actively working in related lab and field work, including a year-round sampling effort at a Yellowtone National Park hotspring. Klapper's research has received funding from the NSF, NIH, and AFOSR.</p></div>

equations and geometric optics</i></a>, for $270,000. From the
abstract: "The research pursued in this project arises naturally in
the design of optical devices (e.g., aspherical lenses, mirrors,
antennas) that have multiple applications in the construction of many
optical and transmission instruments. A large portion of the problems
under study have practical interest, for example, in the design of
lenses focusing light into a desired targeted destination. The impact
of the project lies in the development of a mathematical theory that
would render this design more efficient, precise, and easily and
quickly adaptable to changing situations."<p></p></div>
