and <a

articles concern his research on ``phantom traffic jams.'' To quote
from the New York Times piece (appearing under his own byline):
"These so-called 'phantom traffic jams' can happen without any
obstacles on the road. Instead they are a property of the
flow. Traffic models and simulations show that once traffic volume
exceeds a critical threshold, small perturbations in the flow amplify,
and traffic waves develop. These traffic waves, so called 'jamitons,'
can travel backward along the road, forcing drivers to brake and
accelerate constantly." And: "Our research group, consisting of
researchers in the United States, Canada, and Saudi-Arabia, has found
that jamitons behave much like detonation waves. Using theories that
were originally developed to study explosions, fundamental properties
of traffic waves can be explained and predicted."</p></div>

	<h3>David Futer awarded new NSF grant</h3>

	<div style='margin-top:10px;'><p><p>Assistant Professor David Futer has been awarded a new NSF research
grant, <a
href="http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=1007221">Hyperbolic
geometry of knots and 3-manifolds</a>, for $112,096. From the absract:
"A 3-manifold is a space where an object such as a helicopter can move
around in three distinct perpendicular directions. The universe that
we inhabit is a 3-manifold whose global geometry we do not yet
understand. Another rich source of examples comes from the spaces that
surround different knots. Powerful theorems of Thurston, Perelman, and
Mostow imply that almost every knot complement, and more generally
almost every 3-manifold, has a unique hyperbolic metric. That is,
there is a standard way to measure the space, so that every
2-dimensional cross-section curves like a saddle. At the moment, while
we know that this standard hyperbolic metric exists, very little is
known about how to relate it to easily computable quantities such as
the complexity of a knot diagram. The main goal of this project is to
make these relations much more concrete."</p></div>

	<h3>Benjamin Seibold awarded new NSF grant</h3>

	<div style='margin-top:10px;'><p><p>Assistant Professor Benjamin Seibold has been awarded a new NSF
research grant, <a
href="http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=1007899">Phantom
traffic jams, continuum modeling, and connections with detonation wave
theory</a>. From the abstract: "A 'phantom' traffic jam is a small
congestion in vehicular traffic that occurs spontaneously, in the
absence of bottlenecks, obstacles, or any discernible causes on the
road. Observations show that uniform traffic flow can develop
inhomogeneities, which turn into traveling traffic jams. These traffic
jam waves ('jamitons') enforce unexpected braking maneuvers, and
thus impose stress on drivers and materials, waste fuel and increase
pollution, and are hot spots for potential vehicle collisions. In this
project, the behavior of phantom traffic jams and jamitons is
studied. Theoretical analogies between traffic modeling and gas
dynamics, hydraulics, and astrophysics, are established and used to
advance the understanding of traffic flow. These connections yield
insight into the situations under which phantom traffic jams can
occur, and allow the prediction of the shape and velocity of the
resulting jamitons. A fundamental understanding of phantom traffic
jams is a key step in devising appropriate countermeasures to avoid or
ameliorate them. The development of effective ways to manage or
prevent phantom traffic jams could have a considerable impact on the
reduction of fuel consumption and pollution. Two possible strategies
that will be incorporated into the models and investigated are:
assisted driving devices in the individual vehicles, and adaptively
controlled speed limits on highways. A crucial component of this study
is the interplay between theoretical analysis and numerical
experiments. The research in this project involves three international
collaborations, as well as graduate and undergraduate research
projects."</p></div>

Ehrenpreis. Professor Ehrenpreis, an internationally renowned
mathematician and scholar, had been a member of the Temple University
Department of Mathematics since 1984. Before joining Temple he was a

<a
href="http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=1008092">
Stability and macroscopic properties of heterogeneous media</a>, for
$102,641. From the abstract: "The investigator studies problems
related to composite materials, martensitic phase transformations, and
morphological stability in materials. First, he considers exact
relations and links for effective tensors of fiber-reinforced elastic
composites, by applying the general theory developed by him and his
collaborators. The general theory provides a strategy for finding
every relation and link. However, the actual execution of that
strategy is far from trivial. The case of fiber-reinforced elastic
composites is both important for applications and incredibly
challenging technically, because the microstructure is two-dimensional
while the properties of the composite are represented by
three-dimensional fully anisotropic elastic tensors. This topic builds
on the successful solution of a similar, simpler problem in the
context of Hall-effect conductivity. A second problem concerns
morphological stability of phase boundaries in materials capable of
undergoing martensitic phase transformations." Also: "Heterogeneous
media, or media with internal structure, are of great importance in
applications. Composite materials, which have by now become
ubiquitous, are one example. Another example is shape memory alloys
and other smart materials."</p>

	<h3>New Faculty Member: Vasily Dolgushev</h3>

	<div style='margin-top:10px;'><p><p><a href="http://www.math.temple.edu/~vald">Dr. Vasily Dolgushev</a> joined our department as an
Associate Professor in July. Dr. Dolgushev received his Ph.D. in
mathematics from M.I.T. in 2005, and his Ph.D. in theoretical physics
from the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (Dubna, Russia) in 2003.
He was a postdoc at Northwestern University, and until coming to Temple
he was an assistant professor at University of California, Riverside.
His research interests are in noncommutative geometry, homological
algebra, category theory and mathematical physics. Most of the
problems he is working on are motivated by questions in mathematical
physics. The approaches to these problems involve elaborate techniques
of higher algebraic structures such as homotopy algebras, higher
operads, and higher categories. The solutions of these problems are
also applied to questions in Lie theory, algebraic geometry, and algebraic topology.
Dr. Dolgushev's research is funded by the NSF.</p></div>
