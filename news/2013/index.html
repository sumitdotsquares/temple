<i>A computational framework for atherosclerotic plaque growth
simulations.</i></a> From the abstract: "While it is known that the rupturing
of an atherosclerotic plaque can cause a heart attack, the actual growth
process of plaques in arteries is far from well understood. In this project, a
computational framework is developed that bridges the highly separated time
scales between the plaque growth and the heart rate, and that allows for the
incorporation of accurate models for the elastic arterial walls. This new
framework can yield fundamental insights into the long-term causes of
atherosclerosis, and the dependence of the disease on behavioral factors such
as physical activity, cholesterol intake, and tobacco use."  The total award
amount is $86,277.</p></p></div>

	<h3>New Faculty Member: Matthew Stover</h3>

	<div style='margin-top:10px;'><p>Dr. Matthew Stover joined the Department of Mathematics at the rank of (tenure track) Assistant Professor on July 1, 2013. His Ph.D. is from the University of Texas (Austin), where he studied under Alan Reid. Before coming to Temple, Dr. Stover held a postoctoral position at the University of Michigan (Ann Arbor).
Dr. Stover is interested in Geometry and Topology, Algebraic Groups, and Number Theory. In particular, he is interested in the interaction between these areas, e.g., the geometry and topology of locally symmetric spaces associated with discrete subgroups of Lie groups arising from arithmetic groups. For example, one can understand a great deal about the geometry of hyperbolic manifolds, manifolds admitting complete metrics of constant curvature -1, via the arithmetic of quadratic forms, and much of Stover's work seeks to exploit and better understand these deep connections.</p></div>
