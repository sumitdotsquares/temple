<h1>Math 8107: Mathematical Modeling for Science, Engineering, and Industry</h1>


<h2>Course Instructors (current and past)</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.math.temple.edu/~yury/">Yury Grabovsky</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.math.temple.edu/~klapper/">Isaac Klapper</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.math.temple.edu/~queisser/">Sean Gillian Queisser</a></li>

</ul>


<h2>Course Description</h2>
<p>
This course is quite different from the typical mathematics course. Participating
students work in groups on projects that arise in industry, engineering, or in
other disciplines of science. In addition to being advised by the course
instructors, in all projects an external partner is present. The problems are
formulated in non-mathematical language, and the final results need to be
formulated in a language accessible to the external partner. This means in
particular that the mathematical and computational methods must be selected or
created by the students themselves.
</p>


<h2>Course Goals</h2>
<p>
Students learn modeling by doing. On the way, they train a wide variety of
skills, such as creative modeling, literature and internet research, group
discussions, applied analysis, scientific programming, and presentation skills.
Each student will be a master of his project, and in addition understands and
learns about the other students' projects.
</p>


<h2>Grading</h2>
<p>
The course grading is based on the weekly presentations, the project reports,
and on class participation. The are no exams. More than in traditional lectures,
the success of the project research depends on the students' own creative work.
</p>


<h2>Why Should I Take This Course?</h2>
<p>
The active process of modeling is a crucial component of research in applied
mathematics and related fields. Yet, in traditional lectures it is rarely
taught. In this course, students receive extensive advising and mentoring
in modeling, active research, and interactions with an external partner.
Since the unique experience of this course grows with the diversity of
student backgrounds, <it>students from pure mathematics, as well as other
fields of science and engineering are highly encouraged to contact the
instructors about this course</it>.

In order to decide on the allocation of funds, DVRPC runs large simulations
of the transportation in Philadelphia and adjacent counties in PA and NJ,
enabling predidictions of the travel demand over the next decades.
A crucial component of these simulations are models for the
distribution of trips that residents and employees in the metro area take.

Marble and granite monuments (from the Washington Monument down to
historic grave stones) are affected by lichens and biofilms.
Fundamental question for the preservation of the national heritage are:
Are lichens harmful to the stone? Or could they possibly help preserve the
stone by protecting it from acid rain? Could the cleaning be more harmful
to the stone than the presence of biofilms and lichens?
