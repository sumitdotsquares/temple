<h2>Research interests</a></h2>

<p>

Members of the Probability Group do research on a wide range of topics in probability theory, stochastic processes and their applications. They work mainly on various models that have originated in mathematical physics, and also on problems coming from biology, computer science and
information theory. Their areas of expertise include:
<ul>
	<li>Complex networks</li>
	<li>Determinantal point processes</li>
	<li>Large deviations</li>
	<li>Processes in random environments</li>
	<li>Quantum computing</li>
	<li>Quantum random walks</li>
	<li>Random matrix theory</li>
	<li>Random Schrödinger operators</li>
	<li>Statistical mechanics</li>
	<li>Stochastic homogenization</li>
	<li>Stochastic population dynamics</li>
</ul>

<h2>Events</a></h2>

<p> There is a weekly <a href="/events/seminars/probability">Probability Seminar</a> organized jointly by Temple University and the University of Pennsylvania. It allows interested faculty members, postdocs and graduate students from both universities to be informed about the cutting-edge developments in the field as well as to regularly interact with each other.</p>

<p>The Probability Group participates in the organization of the Northeast Probability Seminar, which is a high-profile annual meeting in the region. Members of the group also take advantage of Philadelphia’s superb location and attend conferences, seminars and workshops organized by nearby universities and institutes.</p>
