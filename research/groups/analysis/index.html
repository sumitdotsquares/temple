 <LI><p class="facnameX"><b>Math 8141-8142: Partial Differential Equations I-II.</b></p>
A partial differential equation (PDE) is an equation involving functions and their partial derivatives, and since many natural laws can be expressed in terms of rates of changes, PDEs appear and have applications in an enormous number of questions. For example, PDEs describe the propagation of sound and heat, the motion of fluids, the behavior of electric and magnetic fields, and the behavior of financial markets. In the first semester the course will focus in the study of three second order equations that contain the ideas and the germ of generality to study more general PDEs: the Laplace equation, the heat equation, and the wave equation. We will also cover first order equations. The solutions of these equations have different qualitative and quantitative properties and their study is essential to understand elliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic equations. The emphasis will be on ideas and techniques presented in a way that can be use later to deal with more difficult situations such us nonlinear equations. These extensions will be the subject of the second semester. 
<br>
The course will be useful for students in analysis, applied mathematics, and engineering.

 <LI><p class="facnameX"><b>Math 9051: Several Complex Variables.</b></p> This is a basic course in the analysis of functions of several complex variables. Beginning with Hartogs' theorem on separate analyticity, the Cauchy representation formula, Hartogs' phenomenon we will build up to domains of holomorphy, pseudoconvexity, and the L<sup>2</sup> theory as developed by H&ouml;rmander. The theory of holomorphic functions of several variables is very different from the theory in one variable.

The course requires the sequences Math 8041-8042 (Real Analysis) and Math 8051-8052 (Functions of a Complex Variable) or their equivalent, or permission of instructor.
