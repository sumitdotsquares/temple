	<h2>
		Graduate Courses in Geometry and Topology
	</h2>

	<p><h3> Math 8061-62: Smooth Manifolds</h3></p>
	<p>
	This course will be an introduction to the geometry and topology of
	smooth manifolds. We will begin the fall semester with the
	definitions: what does it mean for a space to (smoothly) look just
	like R<sup>n</sup>? We will go on to study vector fields, differential
	forms (a way to take derivatives and integrals on a manifold), and
	Riemannian metrics. </p>
<p class = "geom">
In the spring semester, we'll study the interplay between the geometry of a manifold and certain ideas from algebraic topology. We will review the idea of the fundamental group and introduce homology - and then relate these algebraic notions to the underlying geometry. If time permits, we will talk a bit about hyperbolic manifolds - a family of manifolds where the interplay between topology and geometry is particularly strong and beautiful.</p>

	<p>The textbooks for this course are <a
	href="http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Smooth-Manifolds-John-Lee/dp/0387954481/ref=pd_sim_b_5">Introduction

	<p><h3>Math 9021: Riemannian Geometry </h3> </p>

<p> 
The main goal of this one-semester course is to provide a solid introduction to the two central concepts 
of Riemannian Geometry, namely, geodesics and curvature and their relationship. After taking this course, 
students will have an intimate acquaintance with the tools and concepts that are needed for pursuing research 
in Riemannian Geometry or applying its ideas to other fields of mathematics such as analysis, topology, and algebraic geometry.
<!---
 The topics covered include Riemannian metrics, Riemannian connections, geodesics, curvature (sectional, Ricci, and scalar 
 curvatures), the Jacobi equation, the second fundamental form, and global results such as the Gauss-Bonnet Theorem, 
 the theorems of Hopf-Rinow and Hadamard, variations of energy, the theorems of Bonnet-Myers and of Synge-Weinstein, 
 and the Rauch comparison theorem. -->
</p>

	<p><h3>Math 9005: Graph Theory</h3></p>

	<p>
		This course will be an introduction to graph theory.  Some of the topics covered will be:
	</p>
		<ul>
			<li> Trees, connectivity, and matroids</li>
			<li> Matchings and 2-factorizations</li>
			<li> Planarity, duality, and graph drawing</li>
			<li>Random graphs</li>
		</ul>
	<p>
		We'll be using <a href="http://diestel-graph-theory.com/">Graph Theory</a> 
		by Diestel as the main course text, with supplements from more 
		specialized monographs (e.g., <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Matching-Theory-AMS-Chelsea-Publishing/dp/0821847597">Matching Theory</a> by Lovasz &amp; Plummer, <a href="http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Mathematics/PureMathematics/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780199202508">Matroid Theory</a> by Oxley) as necessary.
	</p>




<hr>

<p><h3>Math 9023-24: Knot Theory and Low Dimensional Topology </h3></p>

<p>This course will survey the modern theory of knots, coming at
it from several very distinct points of view. We will start at the beginning
with projection diagrams and the tabulation problem. We will proceed to
several classical polynomial invariants, which can be constructed via the
combinatorics of diagrams, via representation theory, or via the topology of
the knot complement. We will touch on braid groups and mapping class groups,
and use these groups to show that every (closed, orientable) 3-manifold can be
constructed via knots. Finally, we will use these constructions to gain a
glimpse of several skein-theoretic and quantum invariants of 3-manifolds.</p>

<p>Textbooks for this course include <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Theory-Graduate-Texts-Mathematics/dp/038798254X/">An
  Introduction to Knot Theory</a>,
  by W.B. Raymond Lickorish,

<p> <h3>Math 9061-62: Lie Groups </h3></p>
<p class = "geom"> This will be a course on the basic theory of Lie groups
and Lie algebras, with a geometric point of view. We will cover the structure
theory and classification, along with the rich geometry associated with these
groups via the geometry of symmetric spaces. In particular, we will study the
classification of semisimple Lie groups and apply that to classify
low-dimensional homogeneous spaces, which are spaces that `look the same' at
every point. The course will use some Riemannian geometry, but will also
introduce the necessary concepts as we go along.
</p>

<hr>

<p> <h3>Math 9210: Mapping Class Groups and Braid Groups </h3> </p>

<p class = "geom">This course will focus on the symmetry groups of manifolds
and cell complexes. We will look at both the geometric and algebraic
properties of the mapping class group, which can roughly be thought of as the
group of symmetries of a surface. One of the ways in which we will study the
group is by designing a certain cell complex on which it acts by
isometries. This principle has wide generalizations: one can derive a great
deal of information about a group by constructing a geometric object for the
group to act on.</p>
<p class = "geom">In the spring semester, we will focus our attention on the
braid groups, which are a special class of mapping class groups. In
particular, we will study the representation theory of these groups, with
connections to invariants of knots and links.</p>

<hr>

<p> <h3>MATH 9073: Geometric Group Theory </h3> </p>

<p class = "geom">This semester-long course will survey the rapidly expanding 
field of geometric group theory, focusing on the role played by negative curvature. 
We will begin with classical combinatorial techniques used to construct and study 
infinite discrete groups. After introducing basic concepts in coarse geometry, we will 
turn our attention to Gromov's notion of hyperbolic groups. In addition to studying 
geometric, algebraic, and algorithmic properties of these groups, we will keep an 
eye towards several generalizations of hyperbolicity that have recently played a 
large role in understanding many geometrically significant groups. As examples, 
we will also touch on the study of mapping class groups, outer automorphism groups 
of free groups, and cubical groups.</p>

<hr>

<p> <h3>Math 8062: Hyperbolic Manifolds </h3> </p>

<p class = "geom">
This course will be an introduction to discrete groups and hyperbolic manifolds 
via explicit topological constructions. We will begin with the basics of
discrete groups of isometries and hyperbolic 2-manifolds. Then we will consider
geometric structures on knot complements, Thurston's hyperbolic Dehn
surgery theorem, and related explicit constructions of hyperbolic 3-manifolds.</p>

<hr>

<!--	<p>Math 8700/CIS 9615: Analysis of Algorithms</p>
	<p>
		This course will cover the mathematical
		prerequisites (combinatorics, graph theory, asymptotic analysis,
		difference equations) needed for the design and analysis of
		algorithms, followed by the basic topics such as:
	</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Sorting</li>
