        Research Assistant Professor</p>
	<p>
	Ser-Wei studies geometry and topology of low-dimensional manifolds. He
        is interested in motivations and approaches in the fields of
        hyperbolic geometry, geometric group theory, geometric structures,
        ergodic theory, billiards, and Teichmuller theory. His research is
        focused on the geometric aspect (length) and the topological aspect
        (intersection number) of closed curves on surfaces. Curves and
        surfaces, despite basic, still motivates many interdisciplinary and
        open problems. These problems continue to serve as motivation to
        develop new tools and techniques.

<a href="/~mstover/">Matthew Stover</a>, Assistant Professor</p>
<p>
Broadly, Matthew Stover is interested in the interplay between geometry, topology,
number theory, and group theory. Most of his work is on the geometry and
topology of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_space">locally
symmetric manifolds</a>, 
which are Riemannian manifolds
closely related to discrete subgroups of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_group">Lie groups</a>, 
and their
generalizations, especially those spaces arising from arithmetic subgroups of
algebraic groups. He is especially interested in using techniques from number
theory, group theory, and algebraic geometry to understand negatively curved
locally symmetric manifolds, like compact hyperbolic n-manifolds. More
recently, he has started working in the other direction, applying geometric
techniques inspired by ideas in low-dimensional topology to prove theorems in
number theory and algebraic geometry. He also has interests in character
varieties of finitely generated groups, which are spaces parametrizing
representations into a fixed Lie groups, particularly for those groups
appearing in low-dimensional topology.</p>

Stover received his Ph.D. at the University of Texas, where he was a student
of <a href="http://www.ma.utexas.edu/users/areid/">Alan W. Reid</a>.</p>

	<h2>
		Graduate Courses in Geometry and Topology
	</h2>

	<p>Math 8061-62: Smooth Manifolds</p>
	<p>
	This course will be an introduction to the geometry and topology of
	smooth manifolds. We will begin the fall semester with the
	definitions: what does it mean for a space to (smoothly) look just
	like R<sup>n</sup>? We will go on to study vector fields, differential
	forms (a way to take derivatives and integrals on a manifold), and
	Riemannian metrics. </p>
<p class = "geom">
In the spring semester, we'll study the interplay between the geometry of a manifold and certain ideas from algebraic topology. We will review the idea of the fundamental group and introduce homology - and then relate these algebraic notions to the underlying geometry. If time permits, we will talk a bit about hyperbolic manifolds - a family of manifolds where the interplay between topology and geometry is particularly strong and beautiful.</p>

<p>Math 9061-62: Lie Groups</p>
<p class = "geom"> This will be a course on the basic theory of Lie groups
and Lie algebras, with a geometric point of view. We will cover the structure
theory and classification, along with the rich geometry associated with these
groups via the geometry of symmetric spaces. In particular, we will study the
classification of semisimple Lie groups and apply that to classify
low-dimensional homogeneous spaces, which are spaces that `look the same' at
every point. The course will use some Riemannian geometry, but will also
introduce the necessary concepts as we go along.
</p>


<p>Math 9023-24: Knot Theory and Low Dimensional Topology </p>

<p>This course will survey the modern theory of knots, coming at
it from several very distinct points of view. We will start at the beginning
with projection diagrams and the tabulation problem. We will proceed to
several classical polynomial invariants, which can be constructed via the
combinatorics of diagrams, via representation theory, or via the topology of
the knot complement. We will touch on braid groups and mapping class groups,
and use these groups to show that every (closed, orientable) 3-manifold can be
constructed via knots. Finally, we will use these constructions to gain a
glimpse of several skein-theoretic and quantum invariants of 3-manifolds.</p>

<p>Textbooks for this course include <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Theory-Graduate-Texts-Mathematics/dp/038798254X/">An
  Introduction to Knot Theory</a>,

spaces, separation axioms, Urysohn Lemma and Metrization Theorem, continuity,
the Tychonoff Theorem, compactification, the fundamental group, covering spaces.</p>
<p class = "geom">Textbook: <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?index=books&linkCode=qs&keywords=0131816292">Topology</a>,
by James R. Munkres.</p>

<p class = "facname">Math 9210: Mapping Class Groups and Braid Groups </p>
<p class = "geom">This course will focus on the symmetry groups of manifolds
and cell complexes. We will look at both the geometric and algebraic
properties of the mapping class group, which can roughly be thought of as the
group of symmetries of a surface. One of the ways in which we will study the
group is by designing a certain cell complex on which it acts by
isometries. This principle has wide generalizations: one can derive a great
deal of information about a group by constructing a geometric object for the
group to act on.</p>
<p class = "geom">In the spring semester, we will focus our attention on the
braid groups, which are a special class of mapping class groups. In
particular, we will study the representation theory of these groups, with
connections to invariants of knots and links.</p>

	<p>Math 9005: Graph Theory</p>
	<p>
		This course will be an introduction to graph theory.  Some of the topics covered will be:
	</p>
		<ul>
			<li> Trees, connectivity, and matroids</li>
			<li> Matchings and 2-factorizations</li>
			<li> Planarity, duality, and graph drawing</li>
			<li>Random graphs</li>
		</ul>
	<p>
		We'll be using <a href="http://diestel-graph-theory.com/">Graph Theory</a> 
		by Diestel as the main course text, with supplements from more 
		specialized monographs (e.g., <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Matching-Theory-AMS-Chelsea-Publishing/dp/0821847597">Matching Theory</a> by Lovasz &amp; Plummer, <a href="http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Mathematics/PureMathematics/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780199202508">Matroid Theory</a> by Oxley) as necessary.

		This course will cover the mathematical
		prerequisites (combinatorics, graph theory, asymptotic analysis,
		difference equations) needed for the design and analysis of
		algorithms, followed by the basic topics such as:
	</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Sorting</li>
