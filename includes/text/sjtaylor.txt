My research interests include geometric group theory, mapping class groups, hyperbolic 3-manifolds, cubical geometry, and dynamics. In particular, I am interested in analogies between surface topology/geometry (the mapping class group, Teichmuller space, the curve complex, etc.) and the corresponding objects in the study of the outer automorphism group of the free group. At the above link, you can find a list of my papers with links to the arXiv.
