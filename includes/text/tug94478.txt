<p>I am a PhD student at Temple University's Department of Mathematics. Prior to Temple, I earned my B.A. in mathematics from Eastern University, where I also studied in the Templeton Honors College and minored in astronomy. I have general interests in Algebra and Mathematical Biology, and I hope to one day teach at a liberal arts university. When I'm not doing math, I can be found hanging out with friends or enjoying a caramel macchiato.&nbsp;</p>
