<p>I'm a 7th (and final!) year PhD student under the direction of
Matthew Stover.  My mathematical interests lie in the realm of applying
number theoretic tools in hyperbolic geometry.  This includes totally
geodesic surfaces, character varieties, and anything to do with
quaternion algebras.  Non-mathematically, I'm into linguistics and bridges.
