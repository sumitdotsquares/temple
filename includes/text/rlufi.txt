Teaching mathematics has been Rebeca Lufi's lifelong passion. She has found
many different spheres in which to teach, and is always looking for ways to
improve and expand. Continuing to revise teaching techniques in her classroom,
incorporating technology to support learning, and developing math enrichment
programs for elementary and middle school students have been an outgrowth of
Rebeca's passion for teaching.

Rebeca has been teaching in higher education in the greater Philadelphia area since 2013. She has taught at Temple University, Haverford College, Immaculata University, Community College of Philadelphia, and Rowan University and the University of Pennsylvania.
