I have been a member of Temple's Mathematics faculty since 2014, after completing the PhD program at the University of Pittsburgh. I am an Associate Professor of Instruction and have taught and coordinated a variety of mathematics undergraduate courses.  I enjoy the "putting the ball in students' hands" nature of certain active learning strategies and have won a Dean's Distinguished Teaching award.

My research interests include Banach Space Geometry and some questions related to Ranked Preference Voting.  Collaborations with students have included fixed point research questions and voting simulations implemented via Python.
