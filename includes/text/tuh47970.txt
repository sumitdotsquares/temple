<p>My research interests are in modelling industrial projects using partial differential equations (PDEs). In particular, in my thesis I started modelling mould filling for a very well known iron foundry in Paris-France by studying the interface transport scheme of a two-phase flow of an incompressible viscous immiscible fluid. I am also interested in high performance computing. Parallel computing has been the main focus of my recent work. Differential equation models of industrial and physical systems often involve very large linear system to be solved. Asynchronous parallel solvers are new techniques that speed up the computation time.&nbsp;</p>
