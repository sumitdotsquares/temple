Brian Rider's research interests lie in Probability and Mathematical Physics.  His recent work centers on Random Matrix Theory, and the corresponding interplay between probabilistic and integrable methods. Key contributions include the development of the random operator approach to random matrix limit theorems. This has led to, among other thing, novel expressions for the general Tracy-Widom laws, a class of distributions capturing a wide array of nonlinear phenomena from interacting particle systems, stochastic partial differential equations, combinatorics, and high dimensional statistics.
