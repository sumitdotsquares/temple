Professor Wade's research interests include mathematics and statistics education, student and teacher motivation, and learning environments. Most of his work focuses on the relationship between students' motivation and achievement in mathematics/statistics. Currently, he is attempting to better understand a utility value interventions' mechanism of students making material to life connections which lead to beneficial learning outcomes. This is his 6th year teaching within the Mathematics Dept. and/or the Statistics Dept. at Temple University. Professor Wade is also completing a PhD in Education: Science, Mathematics, and Educational Technology at Temple's College of Education where his dissertation is nearing completion.
