I am a 5th year PhD student in the Department of Mathematics at Temple University. After successfully passing all preliminary examinations, I am currently working on my thesis under the direction of Professor Irina Mitrea.My research interests lie at the interface between Harmonic Analysis, Partial Differential Equations and Geometric Measure Theory. My thesis project is focused on the study of invertibility properties of singular integral operators associated with elliptic boundary value problems in non-smooth domains.In my spare time, I enjoy playing some sports and exploring new areas of the city.
