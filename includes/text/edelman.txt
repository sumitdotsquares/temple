I have been a member of Temple's Mathematics faculty since 1991, after completing my B. S. at Queens College in New York and my M. A. at the University of Pennsylvania.  I am an Assistant Professor (NTT) in the department and over the years I have taught a variety of  undergraduate mathematics courses. I have previously taught at the University of Pennsylvania (22 years) and Spring Garden College (23 years).  My goal has always been to motivate students to develop an understanding and appreciation of mathematics.
On a personal note I am a dedicated folk dancer with a strong background in ballet.   I am a performing dancer in the Janosik Polish Folk Dance Ensemble and Monique Legare's International Folk Dance Company.  I am also a member of the board of the Janosik Polish Folk Dance Ensemble and the Metropolitan Ballet Academy and Company.
