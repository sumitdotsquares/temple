I joined Temple's Mathematics department in 2012, after working at Cabrini College for 4 years.  I completed my Ph.D. in mathematics with a focus in graph theory from Lehigh University in 2008 under the direction of Garth Isaac.  I am an assistant professor of instruction and over the years I taught a variety of mathematics undergraduate courses.  My interests include graph theory and mathematics education.
