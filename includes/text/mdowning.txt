After many years of being an accountant, I went back to school and obtained my BS and MS and completed additional course work in Mathematics at Temple.  I have been involved in teaching mathematics at Temple for seventeen years in many different capacities, as a tutor, teaching assistant, course coordinator, and as an instructor.
