I'm a graduate student at Temple University in my sixth (and final) year. My advisor is David Futer. I earned my undergraduate degree with honors in math at Bryn Mawr College.<br>

My research interests are in knot theory and hyperbolic 3-manifolds. In particular, totally geodesic surfaces, right-angled structure, and the commensurability classes of links in thickened surfaces. I have teaching experience as an instructor of record for Calculus I, College Algebra, and Lab for College Algebra. I have also been a teaching assistant for a variety of undergraduate math courses including Complex Analysis and Introduction to Topology and Geometry. I completed the Teaching for Equity Institute at Temple's Center for the Advancement of Teaching and the graduate certificate in Teaching in Higher Education. <br>

While in graduate school, I've co-organized the Graduate Student Conference in Algebra, Geometry, and Topology, the Junior Geometry, Groups, and Topology Seminar, Temple University's Sonia Kovalevsky Mathematics Day for Middle School Girls, and Temple University's Summer Mathematics Interactive Learning Experience (TU SMILE).<br>
