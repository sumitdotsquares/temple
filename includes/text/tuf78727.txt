I study geometry and topology of low-dimensional manifolds. I am interested in approaches and connections in the fields of hyperbolic geometry, geometric group theory, geometric structures, ergodic theory, billiards, and Teichmuller theory. My research is focused on the geometric aspect (length) and the topological aspect (intersection number) of closed curves on surfaces. Curves and surfaces, despite basic, still motivates many interdisciplinary and open problems. These problems continue to serve as motivation to develop new tools and techniques.
