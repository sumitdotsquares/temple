<p>My research interests include mathematical modeling, dynamical systems, parameter estimation, and partial differential equations. I am particularly interested in models related to the medical field because they present an opportunity to gain insights and make advancements that could profoundly impact humanity. Parameter estimation for dynamical systems has been the main focus of my recent work. Differential equation models of physical systems often involve parameters whose values are not known and cannot be directly measured. Parameter estimation is a technique that makes use of experimental data to determine values for these unknown coefficients. The problem of estimating parameters is a vital component of model development that arises in almost all applications of mathematical modeling.</p>
