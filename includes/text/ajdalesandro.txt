I've been teaching college-level Mathematics for 25 years. I received a BA in Physics and an MS in Mathematics from Rutgers-Camden and an MS in Physics from Cincinnati. I've taught previously at Arizona State University and Rutgers-New Brunswick. I enjoy all Philly sports teams (Phillies, Eagles, 76ers, Flyers, Union, and Big 5). I've been known to answer trivia questions on a regular basis around Philly.
