Jaclyn Lang's research interests center on p-adic methods to study questions in algebraic number theory.  She most often works with objects that appear in the Langlands Program - Galois representations and modular forms - and their p-adic deformations.  She is especially interested in congruences between such objects and resulting applications to classical questions about class groups of number fields and elliptic curves.
