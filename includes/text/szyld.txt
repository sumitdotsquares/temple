Daniel Szyld is Professor of Mathematics at Temple University.
He received his PhD at the Courant Institute, New York University, where he attended
after undergraduate studies in his native Buenos Aires.

He has worked on many aspects of numerical linear algebra and 
matrix computations, including eigenvalue problems, sparse matrix 
techniques, preconditioning, Schwarz methods and domain decomposition, 
and Krylov subspace methods. His interests also include asynchronous parallel
methods for the solution of linear and non-linear problems on high-performance
computers.

He has served in multiple editorial boards, and currently he is 
the editor-in-chief of the SIAM Journal on Matrix Analysis and Applications. 
Previously he was an editor-in-chief of the Electronic Transactions on 
Numerical Analysis.

He has served on the Board of the International Linear Algebra Society,
and most recently, as Vice-President at-large of the Society of Industrial and
Applied Mathematics.
