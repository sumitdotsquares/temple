James Sundstrom received his Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania in 2016. His research is in number theory. More specifically, his current research involves using analytic methods to find lower bounds for co-volumes of subgroups of units of number fields. These co-volumes are natural generalizations of the regulator of a number field.
