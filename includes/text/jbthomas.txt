I completed my undergraduate Mathematics degree in Temple's Math Department in 2007, and my M.Ed. from Temple's College of Education in 2008. After student teaching in a high school, I found my true passion lied in higher education and began my career in Temple's Math Department in Fall 2008. I became Coordinator for Math 1022 in Fall 2012.
