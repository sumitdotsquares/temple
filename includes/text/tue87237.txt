Isaac Klapper is interested mathematical applications in the physical and biological sciences, particularly those with connections to fluid dynamics. While he has worked with mathematical problems arising in solar magnetohydrodynamics, especially some related to dynamo activity, his current focus is on study of mixed physical and ecological issues in microbial communities such as biofilms and microbial mats.
