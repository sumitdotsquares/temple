I have been a member of the faculty since 2010, immediately following completion of my PhD. I primarily teach calculus courses, as well as theory of numbers. This has proven to be a very enjoyable pursuit, and it is my greatest hope that my efforts increase my students' appreciation of mathematics, and help them their future endeavors.
