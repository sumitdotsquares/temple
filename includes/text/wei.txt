Wei Wu's main research was to develop new analytical models (by variational analysis) to describe stress transfer into fiber through a partially debonded (crack) interface of two or multiphase composites. The models also provide an accurate estimate of the energy release rate of interfacial crack propagation. An application of the research was to study interface micro mechanics of aerospace composites.
