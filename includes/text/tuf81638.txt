I have been a member of Temple's Mathematics faculty since 2014. Over the years, I taught a variety of undergraduate mathematics courses, teaching is my passion and my goal is to inspire my students. My research interests are on Non-Linear Boundary value Problems with Semipositone structures and on Cancer Treatment plan optimization, especially on IMRT Cancer Radiotherapy.
