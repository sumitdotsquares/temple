<p>I am a PhD student at Temple University's Department of Mathematics. My main interests include Hopf algebras and their representations, noncommutative algebra, and topics in Topology (okay, I really just mean knot theory). I am currently studying under Dr. Chelsea Walton. I already received my Master's degree from Temple, and previously attended the Templeton Honors College at Eastern University, where I also studied philosophy, astronomy, and music. I love to teach and tutor and hope one day to teach at a liberal arts school. While I'm not reading, doing exercises, researching, preparing notes, or grading, I enjoy spending time (and having a drink) with my family and friends, playing games, reading, and occasionally breaking out my guitar.</p>
