<p>I have been a member of Temple's Mathematics faculty since 2014, after completing the PhD program at the University of Pittsburgh. I am a non-tenure-track Assistant Professor and have taught a variety of mathematics undergraduate courses. My research interests include Banach Space Geometry and some connected topics as well as advising undergraduate level research in classical number theory.</p>
