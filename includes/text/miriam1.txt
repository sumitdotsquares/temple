      My earned advanced degrees in Mathematics (Pure and Applied) are as follows: B.S. from Holy Family College, M.S. from Drexel University, M.A. from Villanova University, and Ph. D. from Bryn Mawr College. My published dissertation is in Billiard Systems. I have various other published works in both Mathematics and Creative Writing. I enjoy teaching very much, and plan to complete my 
M. Ed. (at Holy Family University) this Fall.
