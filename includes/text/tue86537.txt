I am a consultant for high-performance scientific computing with an engineering and research background. I see myself as an enabler for computational research by being a bridge between scientists who want to use computers in their research and modern computer technology. My research background helps me to communicate for effectively with scientists. I also enjoy the teaching and training aspects that are invariably a part of this role.
