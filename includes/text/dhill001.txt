I joined Temple University in 1973. My Ph.D. is from the University of Pittsburgh. Mathematical fields of interest include linear algebra, numerical analysis, and instructional computing. I have been actively involved in the Mathematical Association of America and served as president and governor of the MAA's Eastern Pennsylvania and Delaware section. I have received several awards for outstanding teaching including Temple's Great Teacher award. I have co-authored several books in linear algebra and the use of MATLAB; in addition  I am a co-developer of the NSF project Demos with Positive Impact.
