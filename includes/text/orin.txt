I taught at Temple for 42 years until I retired in 2010.  My early research was in combinatorial group theory but most of my career was spent working with Moufang and Bol loops.  I was also heavily involved in service to the Math Department, the college and the university, and I was awarded the Temple University Great Teacher Award in 1995.  My three most important papers are
1.  Induced Automorphisms of Free Metabelian Groups.
2.  Moufang Loops of Small Order.
and
3.  Loops Whose Loop Rings Are Alternative (with E.G. Goodaire).
