Boris Datskovsky's research interests lie in algebraic and analytic number theory. He has worked on the distribution of discriminants of abelian and nonabelian extensions of an algebraic number field, the theory of zeta functions associated with prehomogeneous vector spaces, and arithmetic aspects of the theory of modular forms.
